TEST
First, make an account at GitHub.com (school email is fine).  You will need it to log in through Matlab
Second, open Matlab and go to the folder you want to use for senior design. (preferably an empty subfolder [ don't use spaces in the name of it, use and Underscore]) 
under Matlab go to new and create new project from Git 
make sure you have the right folder picked in the pop-up box.
after that, it will ask for the link to the git repository. That is the following link (https://github.com/Marcus-Trip/VSA_Senior_Design.git)
It will ask you to log in using your git hub account. Then the setup will appear. do nothing and just close out of it.

(following instructions are in the search documentation at the top right of Matlab under "Set Up Git Source Control")
Next try to click the pull button on the top bar. It should not work and a pop-up should tell to download something. follow that link. you will be downloading something called git for windows. download and install the program but don't rush through it. When it asks you at the begin what editor you want you to have to go and choose custom. Then look for you matlab "Application" PATH (mine is as follows: C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2019b\bin\win64\MATLAB.exe) 
Let it install. Once done restart Matlab. In Matlab go to the folder you will be working from and click the file that has the ending [.prj] 
once that opens, try to reclick the pull button and it should pull the files from the cloud. You should see a a README and Marcus_test.

Edit the Marcus_test with your name and date and time. Then save the file and try to push and commit the file.
